                <p><em>Who am <b>I</b>?</em></p>
                <p>I am a motivated, dependable and creative person. Throughout my life I have tried various jobs from 
                    working as a waitress and promoter in High School and University to going overseas to work as an au 
                    pair. Most recently I studied towards and have been working as a Pastry Chef before Covid shut down 
                    the hospitality industry. With Covid changing so many lives I have seen a shift in the way things work 
                    throughout all businesses and I am eager to get into a new field and try something different at this 
                    time of change.
                    An excellent communicator and problem solver with an eye for detail, I am hoping to have my skills 
                    utilised as well as learning new skills while being an asset to your business.</p></td>
